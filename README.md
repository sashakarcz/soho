## Getting started

1. Upload the MPC data file with the file extension .txt
1. Upload the SOHO data file with the file extension .dat
1. Update the variables in the second code cell
1. Press the Restart the kernel and run all cells button. It looks like the fast forward button (>>).

## Running the Notebook

1. At the top of the notebook there is a fast-forward button (>>), click that.

## Saving a plot

1. Plots are automatically saved and are named based on if MPC data and error bars are present.
1. After the notebook has run, you should see a plot in this section. After reviewing it, you may determine that more work will needed and variables may need modified.
1. See [matplotlib docs](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/markers_api.html) for marker types.

## When things are not perfect

1. Breathe
1. Get a cup of coffee or tea
1. Check the Y-Axis limits in variables section. If the limits are wonky, the displayed results will look wrong.
1. Add print statements for variables
1. Check the data files for errors
