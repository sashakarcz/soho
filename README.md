There are two versions of the Notebook:
  1. Automatic: it will read any .txt or .dat file you upload to this directory
  2. Manual: You will need to update the path variable for the data files

## Getting started

1. Make a copy of this directory and rename it to the comet you are interested in.
2. Upload the MPC and SOHO data files into this new directory
3. Update the file variables in the second code block in either the SOHO.ipynb or SOHO-manual.ipynb.

## Running the Notebook

1. At the top of the notebook there is a fast-forward button (>>), click that.

## Saving a plot

1. Click and drag the plot to the file list. This will save the plot as `download.png`.
2. Rename the plot by right clicking on it and selecting `Rename`.
3. To download the plot to your computer, right click the plot and select `Download`.

## When things are not perfect

1. Breathe
2. Get a cup of coffee or tea
3. Check the Y-Axis limits in variables section. If the limits are wonky, the displayed results will look wrong.
4. Add print statements for variables
5. Check the data files for errors
